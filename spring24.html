The chief objective of this course is to introduce standard statistical machine learning methods, including but not limited to various methods for supervised and unsupervised learning problems. Particular focus is on the conceptual understanding of these methods, their applications, and hands-on experience.

<h3 style="color:#1F618D;">Prerequisites</h3>

(1) Undergraduate level training or coursework on linear algebra, (multivariate) calculus, and basic probability and statistics;<br> (2) Basic skills in programming with Python; <br> (3) Undergraduate level training in the analysis of algorithms (e.g. runtime analysis).

           
<h3 style="color:#1F618D;">Syllabus and Materials</h3>

The following is a tentative schedule. The exam timings are fixed, but the rest of the content will likely change as the course continues. We will also post lecture notes and assignments here.<br><br>
    
    Please refer to Ed Discussion for recommended readings.

<div><h3 style="color:#1F618D;">Requirements and Grading</h3></div>

<ol>
    
    <li>  <b> 4 homeworks </b> worth 40% of the grade. The homeworks will be a combination of theoretical and exploratory programming questions. They should be done in <b> groups of 2</b>. Two late days will be available to every student for the homeworks. If a group submits one day late, one late day will be substracted from each group member. A maximum of one late day can be applied to any homework.
    <li> <b>Two exams </b> during class hours worth 20% each. The exams will test conceptual understanding of the material covered in the lectures, discussions and assignments.
    <li> A <b>course project</b> worth 20%. The project should be in <b> groups of 4 students</b>. More information will be released later.
    <li> <b>Contributions to the class</b> (Discretionary Grade Bumps): You are encouraged to help your fellow classmates when possible and improve everyone's learning experience, such as by responding to Ed Discussion questions when you know the answer. At the end of the course, we will bump up grades of those students who had the most positive impact on the class, according to the (quite subjective) judgement of the course staff.

<h3 style="color:#1F618D;">Helpful reminders</h3>



<p><b>Collaboration policy and academic integrity:</b> Our goal is to maintain an optimal learning environment. You can discuss the homework problems at a high level with other groups, but you should not look at any other group's solutions. Trying to find solutions online or from any other sources for any homework or project is prohibited, will result in zero grade and will be reported. To prevent any future plagiarism, uploading any material from the course (your solutions, exams etc.) on the internet is prohibited, and any violations will also be reported. Please be considerate, and help us help everyone get the best out of this course.</p>

<p>Please remember the Student Conduct Code (Section 11.00 of the USC Student Guidebook). General principles of academic honesty include the concept of respect for the intellectual property of others, the expectation that individual work will be submitted unless otherwise allowed by an instructor, and the obligations both to protect one's own academic work from misuse by others as well as to avoid using another's work as one's own. All students are expected to understand and abide by these principles. Students will be referred to the Office of Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards for further review, should there be any suspicion of academic dishonesty.</p>
     
     <p><b>Students with disabilities:</b> Any student requesting academic accommodations based on a disability is required to register with Disability Services and Programs (DSP) each semester. A letter of verification for approved accommodations can be obtained from DSP. Please be sure the letter is delivered to the instructor as early in the semester as possible.</p>
