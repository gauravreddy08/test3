<h3 style="color:#1F618D;">Topics</h3>

<p>We will begin by covering basics of statistical learning theory, in particular the statistical requirement for solving learning tasks. We will cover the following fundamental tools:</p>
<ol>
    <li> Introduction to supervised learning, PAC learning
    <li> Uniform convergence, finite hypothesis classes
    <li> Uniform covergence for parameterized hypothesis classes, covering numbers
    <li> Concentration inequalities, statistics background
    <li> Agnostic learning, bias complexity tradeoff
    <li> VC dimension, Sauer's lemma
    <li> Rademacher complexity, chaining technique, Dudley entropy integral
</ol>
    
    <p>Next, we will shift our focus to the computational side of things. We will cover the following topics (many of these fall under the umbrella of computational learning theory):</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li> Basics of computational complexity, runtime of empirical risk minimization
            <li> Learning conjunctions, intractability of learning 3-term DNF, proper vs. improper learning
            <li> Computational hardness of learning
             <li> Learning in the presence of noise, Statistical Query (SQ) model, lower bounds on SQ learning
             <li> Basics of online learning
             <li> Optimization for machine learning, analysis of gradient descent for convex optimization
    </ol>
    
    <p>The third part of the course (short, around 2 weeks) will cover tradeoffs between computational and statistical requirements:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li> Computational-statistical tradeoffs for statistical inference, the planted clique problem
            <li> Memory-sample tradoffs for learning
    </ol>
        
        <p>Finally, we will move onto student presentations in the last (roughly) three weeks. We will cover a subset of the following topics (depending on student interest):</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li> Theory of deep learning, generalization for deep neural networks
                <li> Covergence of gradient descent for non-convex problems
                    <li> Robust machine learning, robustness to corruptions in training data, robustness to test-time adversarial perturbations
                        <li> Domain adaptation and out-of-domain generalization
                        <li> Bias in machine learning, algorithmic fairness
        </ol>

           <p> The final list of topics could change depending on our pace and the interests of the class. There is no official textbook for this course. Lecture notes and related reading will be posted on this website after each class.</p>
